### Data Quality Audit of Wind Farm Maintenance Logs

#### Summary of Findings
- **Finding 1**: There is a high degree of redundancy between the 'Description' and 'Observations' fields, with approximately 66% of observations merely repeating the description.
- **Finding 2**: The log entries frequently lack specific, quantifiable details, relying on vague descriptions that are insufficient for in-depth analysis.
- **Finding 3**: There is a lack of standardised terminology, leading to inconsistent data entry for similar types of events and failures.
- **Finding 4**: The 'Observations' field is significantly underutilised, often containing redundant information or unhelpful placeholders.

#### Common Issues Identified
1. **Redundant Data Entry**: A prevalent issue is the verbatim replication of text from the 'Description' field into the 'Observations' field, often with the word "para" (for) appended with the log identifier number. This practice renders the 'Observations' field superfluous and adds no analytical value. Furthermore, a substantial number of entries in the 'Observations' field are populated with placholders which indicates a missed opportunity to capture valuable contextual information.

2. **Vague and Ambiguous Descriptions**: Many log descriptions are overly general and lack the precision required for effective root cause analysis. For instance, entries like "Falha de comunicação" (Communication failure) or error codes like "Paragem com o erro 216" (Stop with error 216) do not provide enough context about the affected components or the circumstances of the failure. This ambiguity hampers the ability to perform reliable statistical analysis and trend identification.

3. **Lack of Standardisation**: The absence of a standardised vocabulary for describing components, failures, and maintenance actions results in inconsistent and fragmented data. Similar issues are often described using different terminology, which complicates data aggregation and makes it challenging to accurately track the frequency and history of specific problems across the fleet.

4. **Missed Opportunity for Rich Data Capture**: The 'Observations' field is not being effectively used to record rich, contextual data. Technicians are not consistently logging supplementary details such as specific measurements (e.g., crack lengths, temperature readings), environmental conditions (e.g., wind speed, humidity), or the precise location of a fault on a component. This omission limits the potential for advanced analytics and predictive maintenance modelling.

#### Actionable Recommendations
1. **Implement Structured Data Entry with Clear Field Definitions**:
    - **'Description' Field**: Mandate a concise, standardised format for this field, such as **[Specific Component] - [Observed Problem]**. For example, instead of "Reparação da pá B," the entry should be "Repair of Blade B - 5cm crack on leading edge."
    - **'Observations' Field**: This field should be reserved for detailed, supplementary information. It should include **actions taken, measurements, parts used, and relevant environmental conditions**. For example: "Crack discovered during annual inspection. Location: 15m from blade root. Repaired using resin kit XYZ. Curing time: 24 hours. Wind speed at time of repair: 10 m/s."

2. **Develop and Enforce a Standardised Terminology**:
    - Create a comprehensive glossary of standardised terms for all common components, types of failures, and maintenance actions.
    - Wherever feasible, replace free-text fields with dropdown menus containing the standardised terminology. This will significantly improve data consistency and reduce the likelihood of ambiguous or colloquial entries.

3. **Promote a Culture of Quantitative and Precise Reporting**:
    - Train technicians to quantify their observations whenever possible. For instance, "overheating" should be recorded as "temperature reached 85°C," and "damage" should be specified as "10cm crack."
    - Emphasise the importance of recording the precise location of faults, for example, "Gearbox, high-speed shaft bearing," to aid in future inspections and analyses.

4. **Establish a "No Zero Observations" Policy**:
    - The 'Observations' field should never be left empty or filled with uninformative text.
    - In cases where no additional observations are made, technicians should record the actions taken, such as "Component inspected and confirmed to be in good working order. No further action required." This ensures that every maintenance activity is properly documented.
